# Simulation Results Summary

This directory contains **numerical results** generated by RTL simulation
of the Non-Linear Distortion (NLD) modules.

The data is produced directly from SystemVerilog testbenches and logged
to CSV format for deterministic, tool-agnostic inspection.

No post-processing is required to validate functional correctness.

## Files Overview

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `tb_data_nld_core.csv` | Output of the standalone tanh core (`nld_tanh_core_16`) |
| `tb_data_nld_axis.csv` | Output of the AXI-Stream integrated NLD module |

Each CSV file is generated during simulation and contains
cycle-aligned input and output samples.

## 1. Standalone Core Results (`tb_data_nld_core.csv`)

### Test Scenario

The core-level testbench exercises the following conditions:

- Input signal: sine wave
- Sample rate: 48 kHz
- Two amplitude regions:
  - Low amplitude (near-linear region)
  - High amplitude (intentional saturation)
- Fixed drive setting

Input samples are delayed to align with the fixed pipeline latency
before being logged together with the output.

---

### Observations

From the logged data:

- Output is **sign-symmetric**
- No DC offset is introduced
- Saturation is **soft and bounded**
- Output magnitude never exceeds the Q1.15 range
- Transition from linear to saturated region is smooth

The output follows the expected `tanh()` characteristic
without discontinuities or instability.

---

### Latency Verification

The core exhibits a **fixed latency of 4 clock cycles**.

This latency is constant and independent of input amplitude,
confirming that the pipeline contains no data-dependent behavior.

---

## 2. AXI-Stream Integrated Results (`tb_data_nld_axis.csv`)

### Test Scenario

The AXI-level testbench validates:

- AXI-Stream data flow
- AXI-Lite configuration
- Runtime bypass switching

Test sequence:

1. Initial bypass mode
2. AXI-Lite write to configure drive
3. Enable non-linear processing
4. Continuous streaming operation

A mode label is logged alongside each sample
to distinguish bypass and active regions.

---

### Observations

From the CSV data:

- In bypass mode:
  - Output samples match input samples exactly
  - Latency alignment is preserved
- In active mode:
  - Output exhibits controlled soft saturation
  - Signal peaks are compressed
  - Zero-crossings remain phase-aligned

No sample loss or misalignment is observed during mode switching.

---

### AXI Timing Behavior

- `tvalid` propagation is continuous
- Backpressure is handled correctly via `tready`
- No dropped or duplicated samples are observed
- Bypass and processed paths remain latency-matched

This confirms correct integration between:
AXI-Stream wrapper, pipeline delay, and NLD core.

---

## Numerical Integrity

Across both simulations:

- No arithmetic overflow is observed
- No wrap-around artifacts are present
- All outputs remain within signed 16-bit bounds

This validates correct fixed-point scaling and saturation handling.

---

## Reproducibility Notes

- Results are generated entirely from RTL simulation
- CSV format enables independent verification
- No proprietary waveform viewers are required

The numerical data in this folder is sufficient
to reproduce all functional conclusions described above.

---

## Status

These results confirm that:

- The NLD core behaves deterministically
- AXI integration preserves timing and correctness
- The design meets its defined scope

The validation phase is considered **complete**.
